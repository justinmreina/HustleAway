@section 	Summary
	Start a bi-monthly course at the Reach, helping us retake control of our lives in a world today
	that engulfs and consumes, taking so much
	
	- Bi-monthly one-hour meetings
	- Assigned reading
	- ... evolution and growth to be seen!
	
@section 	Idea
	This is an idea, for those us of adsorbed into the culture of doing more being better and achieving success,
	this mindset is optional, utltimately incurring a cost of its very own!
	
	Lets remove that outer layer, of the hurry and the worry and re-find ourselves, finiding peace within
	and happiness about you -

		• "To Hell with the Hustle" - Jeff Bethke [2]
		
	And still achieve the same results! Central in the teachings of Jeff here, we will meet bi-monthly to
	start

@section 	Coursework
	We will begin by reading portions of the book before each course session, reviewing its contents and sharing
	our notes for review in discussion together
	
	Designed to cater and follow the team needs this book just a start, see 'Web/Ideas' for addtnl ideas
	
@section 	Neat Ideas
	• J.Bethke is a friend of pastor Brian from Kirkland, I would be interested to see his interest in leading a
	session or two, or helping guide and craft its curriculum

	• I have reached out to Darren Mulligan of We are Messengers to see if they have interest in playing a set next
	time they're in town, and joining in for a session if interested
	
	• ... thoughts? Curious on our teams thoughts, perhaps a group here has interest to get this started?
